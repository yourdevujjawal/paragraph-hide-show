# paragraph-hide-show
This is a demo for Theme C paragraph hide show method.

Hello standalone waalo, I have something for you!
For all these months of developing standalones, I faced one issue in every standalone. QA always said, Desktop view me 2 paragraph data dikhao, mobile me 1 parra data dikhna chahiye, aur mobile me v yaha tk ki Pixel 2 me text cut nahi hona chahiye, Galaxy S5 me v nahi hona chahiye, hr device me sahi dikhao. I hope that you have understood ki kon se part ki baat kr rha hu main website ke...iske liye fir hmlog hr ek view ke liye css likhte hain, media query likhte hain aur fir is view k chakkar me wo view grbr ho jata hai... 

So, now, I have developed something. I have written some JavaScript and now adjusting paragraphs in different views will be a piece of cake for everyone. 

For development purpose, I took the html from beta.montereystagecoachlodge.com/overview . To try out my script, just download the code from https://github.com/yourdevujjawal/paragraph-hide-show by clicking green color Code button and then Download ZIP btn. 
Then extract the folder and open the index.html in your editor/IDE and also in browser. 
Now, go to very bottom of the HTML. There you will find four values/variables. Here you can set the number of paragraphs you want to show in the respective view. And see the result. 

I have developed this script by keeping the html structure used in INNsight by SEO and designers. 
Feel free to test this extensively and trying out each use case that you can imagine. I have covered all the cases but may be koi miss ho gya ho. 

Happy Coding !
